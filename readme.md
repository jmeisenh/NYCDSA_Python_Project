## The Search for Value based on Wine Spectator reviews

### Goals
+ Using the kaggle dataset [Zynicide Wine Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)
+ Broad Stroke data discovery
+ Search for bias among reviewers
+ Look for data or trend anomalies and explore
+ Create a feature which finds the highest value (points / cost) for bucketed
prices for different types of wine pairings


### Where's the Beef?
+ Presentation slides has been exported to a pdf 'Analyzing 160,000 Wine Spectator Reviews'
+ The 'scratch_s[ace' notebook is all of my code. I tried to created a narrative to guide anyone interested in my process of creating this project and has been exported as html for easier viewing.
+ The notebook contains a lot of plotly graphs making it a little memory intensive, be patient. It will load
+ The txt file contains useful parameters and lists so I don't have to keep
performing simple Dataframe manipulation to get basic parameters
