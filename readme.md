## The Search for Value based on Wine Spectator reviews

### Goals
+ Using the kaggle dataset [Zynicide Wine Reviews]https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews  
+ Broad Stroke data discovery
+ Search for bias among reviewers
+ Look for data or trend anomalies and explore
+ Create a feature which finds the highest value (points / cost) for bucketed
prices for different types of wine pairings


### Where's the Beef?
+ Most of the work now is being done in the 'scratchspace' notebook.
Here is where I am creating a narrative of my data discovery to be used for a
final presentation
+ The txt file contains useful parameters and lists so I don't have to keep
performing simple Dataframe manipulation to get basic parameters


### Progress

+ People like, pictures...here are a few
